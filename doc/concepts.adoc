== Concepts

MicroProfile Reactive Messaging proposes a model to build data streaming application using a CDI development model. It
is based on 3 main concepts:

* `Message`
* `@Incoming`
* `@Outgoing`

Behind the scene, SmallRye Reactive Streams composes _Reactive Streams_ and ensures the consistent flow of messages.

=== Messages

A `Message` (defined by `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Message`) is an envelope around a payload. The
`Message` interface just offers a way to retrieve the payload (`getPayload`) and to acknowledge the message (`ack`).

The `Message` interface is parameterized with the type of the payload. For example, `Message<String>` describes a
message containing a `String` payload.

The interface can be subclassed by the user or by transport layers to convey more attributes. For example, a `Message`
coming from Kafka contain headers, as well as others metadata.

Acknowledgement is covered below, in a dedicated section.

=== Incoming

`Incoming` is an annotation indicating that the method consumes a stream. The name of the stream is given as attribute
such as in:

```java
@Incoming("my-stream")
public void consume(Message<String> s) {
  // ...
}
```

A method only annotated with `@Incoming` forms the end of a processing chain, often called _sink_:

=== Outgoing

`Outgoing` is an annotation indicating that the method feeds a stream. The name of the stream is given as attribute:

```java
@Outgoing("my-stream")
public Message<String> produce() {
  // ...
}
```

A method only annotated with `@Outgoing` is a sort of data _source_:

=== Methods with @Outgoing and @Incoming

Of course, methods can also use both annotations to transform the incoming messages:

```java
@Incoming("from")
@Outgoing("to")
public String toUpperCase(String input) {
  return input.toUpperCase();
}
```

A method annotated with both annotation is generally called _processor_ or _mediator_:

=== Binding matching @Outgoing to @Incoming

SmallRye Reactive Messaging automatically binds matching `@Outgoing` to `@Incoming` to form a chain:

Methods annotated with `@Incoming` or `@Outgoing` don't have to be in the same _bean_ (_class_). You can distribute them
amount a set of beans. Remote interactions are possible using a _transport_ layer. This topic is covered in another
section.
